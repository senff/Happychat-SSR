## WHAT DOES THIS JAVASCRIPT DO

- adds buttons at the bottom of a message in Happychat if it contains an SSR
- buttons either copy SSR, or open it in a popup
- no need to scroll up all the way anymore (and get caught in the previous chat)

## REQUIREMENTS:

### Tampermonkey
- CHROME: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
- FIREFOX: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/?src=search

With Tampermonkey, you can add your own custom Javascript code to any site, to modify the functionality.


## INSTALLATION:

1. Install Tampermonkey
2. Create a new script, with name "_HappyChat SSR_"
3. Paste the contents of **happychat-ssr.user.js** into the code field
4. **SAVE**
